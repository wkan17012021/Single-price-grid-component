## Overview

A nice challenge to practice css grid. I've been doing a lot of researching, reading, online tutorials and very little coding. So, it was good to practice these skills again.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- vanilla CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to apply a neat sliding button colour animation upon hover state. The link to the example code is provided below.

### Continued development

Keep practicing responsive layouts with grid where applicable.

### Useful resources

- [CSS grid generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) - It would be great if you could seamlessly build grid designs on-the-fly or from memory. But, I can never remember all the properties so I am grateful for apps like this that let you visualise the grid pattern in a model and then quickly return the html and css to import into your proj. Use resources to accelerate your development rather than trying to remember everything.
- [background fill animation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17212094/fill-background-color-left-to-right-css) - This wasn't entirely necessary but adds a nice touch to the cta. I was looking around for a long time to see how this could be done as I often see this feature on professional websites.
